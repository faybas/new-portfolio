# React + Vite

# What I Learned
- Practiced using React components and props
- Cemented my Sass CSS knowledge
- Made the portfolio responsive
- Made skills switchable for each project. I used different technologies for different projects 
  and needed to reflect this.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
